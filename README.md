# InfiniTimer
An Electronic Chaos Timer for use with Infinitron Chaos Events.

Zach Barth mentioned an Electronic Chaos Timer as an option for triggering Chaos Events in Infinitron, and I couldn't find any mention of such a thing online, so this  is officially what an Electronic Chaos Timer is.
It supports any number of evenly weighted random events, each with their own randomized numeric properties (for things like event locations, troop numbers, etc).
All settings are saved for later use when changed, so you can pick right back up where you left off.
